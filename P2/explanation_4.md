Problem 4

Given problem was solved by implement the insertion sort algorithm. There were applied two loops. One for loop and nested while loop. For each loop the time complexity can be estimated for O(n) so the total complexity can be estimated for O(n*n) The space complexity for this time of algorithm can be estimated as O(n).
