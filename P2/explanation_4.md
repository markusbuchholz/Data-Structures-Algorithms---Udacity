Project Explanation


Problem 4

Given problem was solved by single traversing of input list and constructing the output list (data structure used to solve the given problem) according to given specification (0-1-2). Deploying of list indexes and manipulating the data according to applied algorithm it id possible to sort input list. The time efficiency can be estimated for O(n) since the input list (n is the number of elements in the input list) is traversed only once. The space complexity in this case can be estimated for O(n) (where the n is the length of the input array), since deployed algorithm requires an output array to be constructed that is the same size (n) as the input array (n).
