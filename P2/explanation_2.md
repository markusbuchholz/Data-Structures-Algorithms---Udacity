Problem 2

The solution of this problem has been divided by two parts. In first part the algorithm searching the pivot index number (divide the array in two sub-arrays) where the array was rotated and then rotate the given array back. Afterwords, the algorithm (second part) uses the binary search method to find the index of given target.
The binary search algorithm has been deployed in both part of proposed solution so the final time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)). As for the problem 1 applied algorithm is independent from the input therefor the space complexity in this case is O(1).
