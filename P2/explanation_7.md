Problem 7

Regarding problem was solved in the same matter like problem 5 where the trie data structure was deployed. In this time however the time complexity is related directly with the length of the path n so the complexity can be estimated for O(n). The space complexity in considering case is relevant with the paths which  are compared.  The worst case occurs when the path vary of lack common folder (like before  - problem 5 , node has to be added for the path part). In this case the space complexity can be estimated for O(n).
