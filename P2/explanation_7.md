Problem 7

Regarding problem 7 was solved in the same matter like problem 5 where the trie (dedicated tree type data structure to store a strings) data structure was deployed. In this time however the time complexity is related directly with the length of the path so the complexity can be estimated for O(n), where the n represent the length of path to search (n is equal to number of path parts - names/positions between slash signs). The space complexity in considering case is relevant with the paths which  are compared.  The worst case occurs when the path vary of lack common folder (like before  - problem 5 , node has to be added for the path part). In this case the space complexity can be estimated for O(n).
