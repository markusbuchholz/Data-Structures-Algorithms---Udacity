Problem 6

The problem was solve by traversing in for loop the unsorted array (data structure used to solve a given problem). In each iteration latest array value is compared with max and min array values computed previously (compared in previous iterations). The time complexity for this implementation can be estimated as O(n), where the n is the length of the array. The space complexity for this algorithm is independent from the size of input so it can be estimates for O(1).
