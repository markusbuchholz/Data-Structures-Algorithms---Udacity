Project Explanation

Problem 1

The strategy for solving this problem is rather straight forward since only multiplication and comparison were used.  Each time the square root of a number has to be computed the algorithm starts from 1 and traverses all real values while the power of actual traversed number is lower or equal input number
In depicted solution the time complexity is O(n) since the algorithm transverses the integers starting from 0 and each velue has to be visited (verified) in while loop.  
Applied algorithm is independent from the input therefore the space complexity in this case is O(1).
