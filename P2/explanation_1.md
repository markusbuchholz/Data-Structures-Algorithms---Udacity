Project Explanation

Problem 1

The strategy for solving this problem is rather straight forward since only multiplication and comparison were used.  Each time the square root of a number has to be computed the algorithm starts from 1 and traverses all real values while the power of actual traversed number is lower or equal input number
In this case the time complexity is O(log(n)) since  the algorithm transverses the real values. In this case also the algorithm is exhausted (search process is finished) less then in the middle of (n).  
Applied algorithm is independent from the input therefore the space complexity in this case is O(1).
