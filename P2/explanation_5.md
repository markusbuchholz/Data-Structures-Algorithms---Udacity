Problem 5

This problem was solved (requirement) by deploying the trie data structure (dedicated tree type data structure to store a strings). The time complexity for this data structure is directly relevant with the length of world k and number of words n. The worst case scenario (while inserting and searching) for the time complexity can be estimated for O(k*n). The worst scenario for the space complexity (for the trie) can be estimated for O(n) and it happens when there is no common letters between words (each letter has a node).
