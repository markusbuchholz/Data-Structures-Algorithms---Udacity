Project Explanation

Problem 5

This problem was solved (requirement) by deploying the trie data structure.  The time complexity for this structure s directly relevant with the length of world k  and number of words. The worst case scenario (while inserting and searching) for the time complexity can be estimated for  O(k*n).  The worst scenario for the space complexity (for the trie) can be estimated for O(n) and it happens when there is no common letters between words (each letter has a node).
