Problem 3

Similarly to solution displayed while solving problem 2 the algorithm was divided by two parts. First by use of merge and sort the give input array is sorted. The time complexity for this part can be estimated for O(nlog(n)) In second part the the required numbers are computed. In discussed art the while loop was used so the time complexity is O(n). Finally the time complexity of mentionedÂ  above two parts of deployed algorithm can be estimated as O(nlog(n)) - merge and sort algorithm deployed in first part of presented solution. 
The space complexity, based on deployed merge and sort algorithm can be estimated as O(n).
