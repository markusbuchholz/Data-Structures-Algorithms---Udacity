### Problem 6.Â Explanation ###

Given problem was solved by implementing the linked lists which hold list elements. In order to compute Union or intersection of two given lists the comparison in while loop is performed.
Result of each of this operation is stored in new list which is returned. For computation of union, one for loop was used so the time complexity can be estimated as O(n).
Computation of intersection demands also one for loop therefore the time complexity can be estimated as O(n).
Space complexity for both cases (union and intersection) are the same (compared with True elements are stored) and can be estimated as O(n)
