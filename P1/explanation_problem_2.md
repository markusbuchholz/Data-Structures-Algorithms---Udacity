### Problem 2. Explanation ####

Given problem has been solved by deploying  recurrention. The algorithm is exhausted (finishes checks) when the potential list of the file paths is empty. While the recurrention algorithm  is running the counts the file of interest are registered
The time and space complexity can be estimated for O(n) - we perform only one check per file.
